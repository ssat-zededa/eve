# Cleanup

This is a simple list of general "cleanup" items, a "tech debt" to-do list:

* Makefile should not cause `docker pull` until an actual target is invoked. Currently, even `make -n <target>` invokes `parse-pkgs.sh` which pulls down images.
* Making an existing target image should not rebuild it unless explicitly told to. Currently, `make live` will _always_ rebuild it, as opposed to seeing that it exists.
* [pillar](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve/tree/master/pkg/pillar) as documented [here](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve/blob/master/docs/COMMS.md) is a catch-all that contains many different utilities and services merged in a single image and therefore container. This needs to be separated properly for security and maintainability.
